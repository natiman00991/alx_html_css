In this project, you will be creating a basic webpage layout using HTML and CSS, and applying CSS Flexbox to achieve a specific layout. The goal is to have a header, main content area with an article and aside, and a footer. Additionally, you will make the webpage responsive for smartphones by adding a class attribute. Below are the steps and guidelines to complete the project:

Step 1: File Structure
Create a new folder for your project.
Copy the files index.html and tweets.html from the previous project into this folder.
Create an empty styles.css file.
Create a file named base.css and set the initial styling rules in this file.

Step 2: Linking CSS Files
In each HTML file (index.html and tweets.html), add the following lines within the <head> tag to link the CSS files:

Step 3: Applying Flexbox for Layout
Open the styles.css file and follow these steps to apply Flexbox for the layout:

Make the <body> and <main> elements flex containers:

Step 4: Responsive Web Design
To make the webpage responsive for smartphones, add the works_on_smartphone class attribute to the <body> tag in the index.html file:

Step 5: Custom Styling
Now, you have the basic layout set up with Flexbox. You are allowed to add any non-positioning-related CSS rules to the styles.css file to style your webpage as you wish. You can experiment with colors, backgrounds, borders, and more.

You can also add a logo to the top-left of your page. To do this, you can use a unicode character. Add a first item in the list within the <header> tag in index.html, and put the HTML code for the character inside it. To make it look like a logo, you can use the class attribute:

Note
Please refrain from changing the layout strategy achieved with CSS Flexbox. You can experiment with positioning within the <article> tag if you wish, but avoid modifying the Flexbox layout anywhere else to maintain the desired layout.
