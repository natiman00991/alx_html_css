## This project is a CSS styling exercise based on the Figma file linked above. The goal is to create a website that matches the design in Figma as closely as possible.

## The project is divided into seven tasks, each of which focuses on a different section of the website. The tasks are as follows:

- Import the style
- Header and Banner
- Quotes
- Videos list
- Membership
- FAQ
- Footer

## To complete the project, you will need to use the Figma file as a reference and write CSS code that matches the design. You will also need to import the styles.css file into your index.html file.

- The final result should be a website that matches the design in Figma as closely as possible.

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file must be included at the root of the project folder.
- The project must be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries are allowed.
- The code must be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator

- Use the Figma file as a reference for the design.
- Keep your CSS code simple and clean.
- Use as simple as possible CSS selectors.
